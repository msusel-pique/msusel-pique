/**
 * A diagnostic object contains a collection of Findings that matches this object's ID and
 * defines how to evaluate its Finding collection -- for example, a count.
 *
 * A diagnostic can also be thought of as a "rule" or the ID of a finding a static analysis tool
 * attempts to find.
 *
 * Diagnostic objects are the components a Measure object needs to run its evaluation.
 *
 * Metrics example: for a metrics Measure "MIF" (Method Inheritance Factor) that is evaluated by the formula
 *          MIF = inherited methods / total methods available
 * and you have a static analysis tool that can find IM (inherited methods) and TMA (total methods available),
 * IM and TMA are Diagnostic objects, and the Measure object MIF's eval function is IM / TMA.
 *
 * Rule example: for a rule Measure "Encryption Faults" that is evaluated by the sum of all tool findings that relate
 * to encryption, imagine a tool named Security Code Scan that has 3 rules relating to encryption, "SCS001", "SCS002",
 * and "SCS003".  SCS001, SCS002, and SCS003 are Diagnostic objects whose eval function should be to sum the findings
 * with their Diagnostic name.  The Measure "Encryption Faults" would then eval by suming its diagnostic object's evals.
